# Masters-Thesis
The repository contains the code used to obtain the results for my Master's thesis on Extended Bradley-Terry Models.
R packages required: dplyr and ggplot2

Functions.R provides all the functions that have been built for the thesis.
Implementation.R provides the main functions that have been used to obtain the results for the thesis.
Simulation.R traces the steps taken to simulate the NBA playoffs of the 2022-23 season. However, this can be used to simulate any NBA playoffs with a regular
home-and-away format, with a few changes.
SimulationNBA.R introduces the basic steps of the simulation of the NBA playoffs of the 2022-23 season, as a different approach is taken, as mentioned in the thesis.
